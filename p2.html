            <h2>Structural Efficiency through Material Distribution:</h2>
            <p class="para">The design of an I beam maximizes structural efficiency by concentrating additional material 
                in areas subjected to high stress. This distribution of material enables the I beam to 
                withstand substantial bending loads while utilizing minimal resources. The second moment of 
                area, which describes a beam's resistance to bending, is significantly enhanced by the I 
                beam's material allocation.
